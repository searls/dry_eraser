# dry_eraser ‚Äì a _dry_ run before you _erase_ your models

This gem is for people who think it's weird that Rails offers so many ways to
validate models before you create and update them, but all it gives you is a
`before_destroy` hook before you permanently destroy them.

Think of `dry_eraser` as adding a validation feature to `ActiveRecord#destroy`.
To that end, it defines `dry_erase` and `dry_erasable?` methods for your models,
which behave analogously to `validates` and `valid?`, respectively. This way,
you won't need to register a `before_destroy` callback and then remember that
`throw(:abort)` is the magical incantation needed to cancel the callback chain.
If you're suspicious of pulling in a dependency for something like this (and you
should be), the fact its [implementation is 50 lines soaking
wet](lib/dry_eraser.rb) will hopefully put you at ease.

Here's how to use it.

## Install

Add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "dry_eraser"
```

Then run `bundle install`. That's it. Rails should load it automatically.

## Usage

Whenever there's a situation in which you know you _don't_ want to `destroy` a
model, you can specify it by calling the `dry_erase` class method in the model's
class.

Let's take an example `Whiteboard` model. Suppose it has a boolean attribute
called `someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me` and you want to be sure `destroy`
operations are aborted when that attribute is `true`.

You could:

```ruby
class Whiteboard < ActiveRecord::Base
  dry_erase :no_one_said_not_to_erase_it

  private

  def no_one_said_not_to_erase_it
    if someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me?
      errors.add(:someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me, "so I can't erase it")
    end
  end
end
```

This way, whenever `someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me?` is true, `destroy` will
return `false` (just like `save` returns false when validations fail).

This, combined with the fact that `dry_erase` determines success based on the
absence or presence of `errors` on the model instance will allow you to write
code that branches on whether destroy succeeded, just like you would for `save`
or `update`:

```ruby
whiteboard = Whiteboard.create!(someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me: true)
if whiteboard.destroy
  flash[:notice] = "Whiteboard deleted!"
  redirect_to whiteboards_path
else
  flash[:error] = whiteboard.errors.full_messages
  render :show, status: :unprocessable_entity
end
```

Want know whether a model is can be safely destroyed before you `destroy` it?
You can also call `dry_erasable?` and it'll either return `true` or return
`false` (and populate the `errors` object all the same):

```ruby
whiteboard = Whiteboard.create!(someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me: true)
whiteboard.dry_erasable?
=> false
whiteboard.errors.full_messages.first
=> "Someone wrote do not erase on me so I can't erase it"
```

Important consequence of this design: since `dry_eraser` mutates the same
`errors` object as built-in validations do, calling `dry_erasable?` or `destroy`
will _clear_ the model's `errors` object first.

## Other stuff you can pass to `dry_erase`

The `dry_erase` method can take one or more of any of the following:

* A symbol or string name of an instance method on the model
* A class that has a no-arg constructor and a `dry_erase(model)` method
* An object that responds to a `dry_erase(model)`
* An object (e.g. a proc or lambda) that responds to `call(model)`

You can see all of these uses in the gem's [test fixture](test/fixtures.rb):

```ruby
# You can specify multiple dry erasers at a time
dry_erase :must_have_content, AnnoyingCoworkerMessageEraser

# Or pass a lambda
dry_erase ->(model) { model.content == "üñçÔ∏è" && model.errors.add(:base, "No crayon, c'mon!") }

# Or an instance of a class (which allows it to receive static configuration in an initializer)
dry_erase ForeignKeyEraser.new(Classroom, :whiteboard)
```

And that's about it.
