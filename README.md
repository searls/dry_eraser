# dry_eraser ‚Äì a _dry_ run before you _erase_ your models

This gem is for people who think it's weird that Rails offers so many ways to
validate models before you create and update them, but all it gives you is a
`before_destroy` hook before you permanently destroy them.

Think of `dry_eraser` as adding a validation feature to `ActiveRecord#destroy`.
To that end, it defines `dry_erase` and `dry_erasable?` methods for your models,
which behave analogously to `validates` and `valid?`, respectively. This way,
you won't need to register a `before_destroy` callback and then remember that
`throw(:abort)` is the magical incantation needed to cancel the callback chain.
If you're suspicious of pulling in a dependency for something like this (and you
should be), the fact its [implementation is 50 lines soaking
wet](lib/dry_eraser.rb) will hopefully put you at ease.

Here's how to use it.

## Install

Add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "dry_eraser"
```

Then run `bundle install`. That's it. Rails should load it automatically.

## Usage

Whenever there's a situation in which you know you _don't_ want to `destroy` a
model, you can specify it by calling the `dry_erase` class method in the model's
class.

Let's take an example `Whiteboard` model. Suppose it has a boolean attribute
called `someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me` and you want to be sure `destroy`
operations are aborted when that attribute is `true`.

You could:

```ruby
class Whiteboard < ActiveRecord::Base
  dry_erase :no_one_said_not_to_erase_it

  private

  def no_one_said_not_to_erase_it
    if someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me?
      errors.add(:someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me, "so I can't erase it")
    end
  end
end
```

This way, whenever `someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me?` is true, `destroy` will
return `false` (just like `save` returns false when validations fail).

This, combined with the fact that `dry_erase` determines success based on the
absence or presence of `errors` on the model instance will allow you to write
code that branches on whether destroy succeeded, just like you would for `save`
or `update`:

```ruby
whiteboard = Whiteboard.create!(someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me: true)
if whiteboard.destroy
  flash[:notice] = "Whiteboard deleted!"
  redirect_to whiteboards_path
else
  flash[:error] = whiteboard.errors.full_messages
  render :show, status: :unprocessable_entity
end
```

Want know whether a model is can be safely destroyed before you `destroy` it?
You can also call `dry_erasable?` and it'll either return `true` or return
`false` (and populate the `errors` object all the same):

```ruby
whiteboard = Whiteboard.create!(someone_wrote_do_not_erase_on_me: true)
whiteboard.dry_erasable?
=> false
whiteboard.errors.full_messages.first
=> "Someone wrote do not erase on me so I can't erase it"
```

Important consequence of this design: since `dry_eraser` mutates the same
`errors` object as built-in validations do, calling `dry_erasable?` or `destroy`
will _clear_ the model's `errors` object first.

## Other stuff you can pass to `dry_erase`

The `dry_erase` method can take one or more of any of the following:

* A symbol or string name of an instance method on the model
* A class that has a no-arg constructor and a `dry_erase(model)` method
* An object that responds to a `dry_erase(model)`
* An object (e.g. a proc or lambda) that responds to `call(model)`

You can see all of these uses in the gem's [test fixture](test/fixtures.rb):

```ruby
# You can specify multiple dry erasers at a time
dry_erase :must_have_content, AnnoyingCoworkerMessageEraser

# Or pass a lambda
dry_erase ->(model) { model.content == "üñçÔ∏è" && model.errors.add(:base, "No crayon, c'mon!") }

# Or an instance of a class (which allows it to receive static configuration in an initializer)
dry_erase ForeignKeyEraser.new(Classroom, :whiteboard)
```

And that's about it.

## A real-world example

I'm currently developing an app for [my wife Becky's
business](http://www.betterwithbecky.com) and I'm modeling various
strength-training concepts. One model, `Movement`, depends on one or two pieces
of `Equipment`. Becky should be able to delete equipment records, but only if they
aren't currently assigned to any movements.

As you might guess, this concern is enforced in the database with a foreign key,
which was configured in the migration that defines the `movements` table.
Imagine something like this:

```ruby
create_table :movements do |t|
  t.string :name, null: false

  t.references :primary_equipment, foreign_key: {to_table: :equipments}, null: true
  t.references :secondary_equipment, foreign_key: {to_table: :equipments}, null: true

  t.timestamps
  t.unique_constraint :name
  end
end
```

Because `destroy` doesn't provide an easy way to run pre-flight validations, I
found myself writing a controller action like this on `EquipmentsController`:

```ruby
def destroy
  Equipment.find(params[:id]).destroy!
  flash[:notice] = "Equipment deleted!"
  redirect_to admin_equipments_path
end
```

Using a foreign key constraint and `destroy!` like this will indeed "work"
insofar as it will prevent `Movement` records from holding orphaned `Equipment`
references, but instead of seeing a pleasant error message generated at the
application layer, the user (/my spouse) will either see some gobbledygook
generated by Postgres or, worse, a generic 500 page.

Let's use `dry_eraser` to make this nicer!

All we need to do is define a dry eraser on the Equipment model to prevent its
deletion when it's still associated with any movements.

Since an `Equipment` can either fill a primary or secondary role in a `Movement`,
there are two foreign keys to consider as we use `dry_erase` to add what amounts
to a pretty normal-looking validation method:

```ruby
class Equipment < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :primary_movements, class_name: "Movement", foreign_key: "primary_equipment_id"
  has_many :secondary_movements, class_name: "Movement", foreign_key: "secondary_equipment_id"

  validates :name, presence: true, uniqueness: true

  dry_erase :no_associated_movements

  private

  def no_associated_movements
    if primary_movements.exists? || secondary_movements.exists?
      errors.add(:base, "Cannot destroy equipment because associated movements exist.")
    end
  end
end
```

Okay, now that we know destroy will abort when the operation is unsupported, we
can change our `destroy!` to `destroy` and wrap it in an `if`/`else` that will
more gracefully handle the situation in the user interface:

```ruby
def destroy
  @equipment = Equipment.find(params[:id])
  if @equipment.destroy
    flash[:notice] = "Equipment deleted!"
    redirect_to admin_equipments_path
  else
    flash[:error] = @equipment.errors.full_messages
    render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end
```

Squint and it looks like a `create` or `update` action.

To test that this is all working, we can throw up a link and see what happens
when we try to delete an `Equipment` that's associated with a `Movement`:

```erb
<%= link_to "Delete equipment",  admin_equipment_path(@equipment),
  data: {
    turbo_method: :delete,
    turbo_confirm: "Are you sure you want to delete this equipment?"
  }
%>
```

(The hardest part here is remembering that Rails 7 changed `data-confirm` to
`data-turbo-confirm`.)

Anyway, click that link, then click OK on the confirm dialog and‚Ä¶ ü•Å drumroll ü•Å‚Ä¶

![A flash message explaining the deletion attempt was
invalid.](https://github.com/searls/dry_eraser/assets/79303/1ace01c6-2524-40e5-9f69-65542a9dc7f0)

Yahtzee! We did it! See, that wasn't so bad.

## Extra credit assignment

To see a different way of accomplishing the same thing, we could also have
created a class that took configuration values in an initializer and then handled
each `destroy` attempt by implementing a `dry_erase(model)` method. Let's
refactor our approach to do that instead:

```ruby
dry_erase ForeignKeyEraser.new(association: :primary_movements)
dry_erase ForeignKeyEraser.new(association: :secondary_movements)
```

And then we can implement that class anywhere we like:

```ruby
class ForeignKeyEraser
  def initialize(association:)
    @association_name = association
  end

  def dry_erase(model)
    if model.association(@association_name).scope.exists?
      model.errors.add(:base, "Cannot destroy #{model.model_name.human} because associated #{@association_name.to_s.humanize} exist.")
    end
  end
end
```

The above reflects on the provided association name to look for existing records,
but we could have just as well taken a model and column name. Hopefully, this
gives you the general idea.

Now, let's make sure this works by trying to delete the equipment again:

![Cannot destroy Equipment because associated Primary movements exist.](https://github.com/searls/dry_eraser/assets/79303/de691f8b-e82a-4db6-9c57-f62639b6936e)

Even better!

Okay, job's done. Happy erasing!
